## Overview and Motivation
      The Space Bar Game is a 2D game created in Unity 5. This game is a basic block breaking game, modeled after the Arkanoid games, popular in the late 1980's. My main motivation in creating this game was to attempt creating a game in a language I had never programmed in, on a platform I had never utilized, creating something I had never attempted to create before (a video game). I wanted to take on the challenge of utilizing all of these skillsets. Furthermore, I wanted to complete this challenge, in a 5-day time frame.

## Technologies Used

### Unity 5 -

    Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies[4] and used to develop video games for PC, consoles, mobile devices and websites. First announced only for OS X, at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, it has since been extended to target 21 platforms.It is the default software development kit (SDK) for the Wii U.

      Five major versions of Unity have been released. At the 2006 WWDC show, Apple Inc. named Unity as the runner up for its Best Use of Mac OS X Graphics category.
      
### Monodevelop - 

    Monodevelop is a cross platform IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which I utilized, when creating my C# scripts.
    

### C# -

    All of the scripting for this game was done in C#, a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
    

### Gimp - 

    GIMP /ɡɪmp/ is a free and open-source raster graphics editor used for image retouching and editing, free-form drawing, resizing, cropping, photo-montages, converting between different image formats, and more specialized tasks.

## Adobe Photoshop CC - 

    Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for Windows and OS X. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll.


## Challenges

      One of the major challenges of this project was our time constraint. The timeline for this project from start to finish was five days. While five days may be enough time to produce an app in a discipline one is familiar with, it is a borderline insane endeavor for one that knows nothing about the language or gaming platforms, to speak of. 

      The learning curve was an obvious challenge, but more so due to having no prior knowledge of gaming engines. While I hadn't programmed in C#, prior to this project, I found it to be less of a challenge than navigating Unity, itself. 

      My greatest challenge, should become a learning lesson for all Unity beginners. Thou shalt not watch tutorials from deprecated versions of Unity and expect new releases to perform the same. This was a HUGE learning lesson for me, as Unity 5 changed drastically from Unity 4 (both in layout and in scripting syntax structure). I can not begin to tell you how many hours were spent beating my head against the wall with this one.
