## Overview and Motivation
The Space Bar Game is a 2D game created in Unity 5. This game is a basic block breaking game, modeled after the Arkanoid games, popular in the late 1980's. My main motivation in creating this game was to attempt creating a game in a language I had never programmed in, on a platform I had never utilized, creating something I had never attempted to create before (a video game). I wanted to take on the challenge of utilzing all of the skillsets listed.. and I wanted to do this in the 5 day time frame, our class was given for our final project.

      Five major versions of Unity have been released. At the 2006 WWDC show, Apple Inc. named Unity as the runner up for its Best Use of Mac OS X Graphics category.
      
### Monodevelop - 

    Monodevelop is a cross platform IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which I utilized, when creating my C# scripts.
    

### C# -

    All of my scripting for this game was done in C#, which is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
