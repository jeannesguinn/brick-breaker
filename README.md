## Overview and Motivation
The Space Bar Game is a 2D game created in Unity 5. This game is a basic block breaking game, modeled after the Arkanoid games, popular in the late 1980's. My main motivation in creating this game was to attempt creating a game in a language I had never programmed in, on a platform I had never utilized, creating something I had never attempted to create before (a video game). I wanted to take on the challenge of utilzing all of the skillsets listed.. and I wanted to do this in the 5 day time frame, our class was given for our final project.
